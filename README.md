## Learning README

### Purpose:
These assignments aim to reinforce understanding and practice with fundamental programming concepts such as recursion, array manipulation, and algorithm design.

### Assignments:
1. **Fibs and FibsRec:**
   - Purpose: To implement the Fibonacci sequence calculation algorithm using both iterative and recursive approaches.
   - Key Learnings: Understanding the Fibonacci sequence, recursion fundamentals, and comparing iterative vs. recursive solutions.

2. **Merge and MergeSort:**
   - Purpose: To implement the merge sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
   - Key Learnings: Understanding the merge sort algorithm, array manipulation techniques (e.g., slicing), and algorithmic complexity.
